# What does it do?
This program makes it easy to look up the staking rewards of an account and link it to daily prices to calculate the total amount of stake rewards in fiat. For the lookup on staking rewards, the Polkastats.io database is used (GraphQL) and the prices are queried from CoinGecko API. The command window will lead you through the process and at the end it generates a .csv export for furthr use.
